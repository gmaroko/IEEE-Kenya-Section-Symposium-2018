# To construct their prototype, we use coils of copper                #
# wires insulated with PVC tubing. At one end of this arrangement,    # 
# the wires terminate at a receiver and analyzer, while at the other  #
# end the wires are formed into coils that wind around three parts of #
# the body: the head, the arms, and the legs. In this way, the coils  #
# act as inductors for the application of energy and the production   #
# of magnetic fields and allow the body itself to act as a sort of    # # waveguide for those fields. Using this system, we're able to        #
# transmit and measure ultra-low path loss signals from from arm to   #
# arm, from arm to head, # and from arm to leg.                       #
